#####  COVID 19 Patient Questionnaire

COVID 19 has definitely made an impact on the world this year. For many reasons, this pandemic has been especially hard for the health industry. 

For this project, I wanted to do something that was both topical, but also practical. My program is a short but useful questionnaire that, in specific situations, could be incredibly useful to the world today. 

In a hypothetical situation, my program is created to allow patients, or nurses helping patients, take this 'survey' and use it to both record information about someone, and also calculate the severity of the patient's risk of the coronavirus.
